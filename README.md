## Overview

This project is a demonstration of a highly scalable web application built using Vue, Vite, TypeScript, Jest and Bootstrap. It covers all the front-end fundamentals.

### Vue Basics

- [x] Use props to pass data to child components.
- [x] Manage component state using Vue's reactive data properties.

### Routing:

- [x] Implement client-side routing using Vue Router or a similar library.
- [x] Set up routes for different pages like home, product listings, product details, cart, and checkout.

### State Management:

- [ ] Manage global application state using tools like Vuex or Vue 3's Composition API for local state management.
- [ ] Handle state for features like user authentication, shopping cart, and product selection.

### User Authentication:

- [ ] Implement user registration and login functionality.
- [ ] Secure routes and data based on user authentication.
- [ ] Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

### Data Fetching:

- [ ] Fetch data from an API (e.g., RESTful or GraphQL) to populate product listings.
- [ ] Use Axios, Fetch API, or GraphQL libraries for data retrieval.

### Product Listings:

- [ ] Display a grid or list of products with images, titles, prices, and descriptions.
- [ ] Implement filters and sorting options for product listings.

### Product Details:

- [ ] Create a product detail page with additional information about a selected product.
- [ ] Allow users to add items to the cart from this page.

### Shopping Cart:

- [ ] Develop a shopping cart component to display added products.
- [ ] Implement functionality to add, remove, and update quantities of items.
- [ ] Calculate and display the total price.

### Forms and Validation:

- [ ] Create forms for user registration, login, and checkout.
- [ ] Implement form validation and error handling.

### Styling:

- [x] Use CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or CSS preprocessors (e.g., SCSS) for styling. Alternatively, use Vue's scoped CSS.
- [x] Ensure a responsive design for various screen sizes and devices.

### Third-Party Libraries:

- [x] Integrate third-party libraries for features like image carousels, payment processing, or social sharing.

### Error Handling:

- [ ] Handle errors gracefully and provide feedback to users.
- [ ] Implement error boundaries to prevent crashes.

### Performance Optimization:

- [x] Optimize application performance by lazy loading components, using memoization, and minimizing re-renders.

### Testing:

- [ ] Write unit tests and integration tests for your components and functionality.
- [ ] Use testing libraries like Jest or Vue Test Utils.

### Security:

- [ ] Implement security best practices, such as sanitizing user input, protecting against XSS and CSRF attacks, and securing APIs.

### Accessibility:

- [ ] Ensure your application is accessible to all users by following web accessibility guidelines (WCAG).

### Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n):

- [ ] Support multiple languages and regions by implementing i18n and l10n.

### Documentation:

- [x] Document your code, components, and project structure for future maintainability.

### Version Control:

- [x] Use Git for version control and collaborate with a team if applicable.

### Scalability and Future Considerations:

- [x] Plan for scalability as your e-commerce site grows.

### SEO Optimization:

- [ ] Implement on-page SEO techniques to improve search engine rankings.

### Feedback and Support:

- [ ] Provide ways for users to contact support or leave feedback.
